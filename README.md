# ansible
Ansible files for my network.

These are ansible configuration and playbook files that I use on my systems.  My goals are to be able to set up different *nix OS to do the same end tasks for consistency.

I am learning roles and separating each role to its own repository.  This repository should shrink in size as I convert existing playbooks to roles.
